My AI looks at the already placed tiles and compares the possible ways to win with the possible ways to lose, and chooses the route that blocks off the most possible ways to win for the opponent.
To make this AI better I would add a check to check for potential danger like 2 pieces with nothing around it, or checking for 3 pieces to block it off. 
I would also add a way to check if there is a immediate win and to take it.
